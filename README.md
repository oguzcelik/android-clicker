# Android Clicker

A simple clicker app made with Firebase & Java

## How to use this project

Follow the instructions on my [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@oguzcelik/diy-clicker-with-java-firebase-6ca8d1b99450#.5n6diz72b)

### Prerequisities

You need a free Firebase account.

Java should be installed on the computer you're going to present with.

I've removed the google-services.json file which is generated for you by Firebase but you should include yours in the app folder. Get it from the firebase site and add to your project.
